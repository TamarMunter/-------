# Simon-Game
Attached is a memory game called "Simon".
To activate the game, run the file Simon.py.
The goal of the game is to improve memory skills.
You can play the game in two modes using the TAP keyboard.
Play in the first mode:
When the keyboard is in "Text" mode,
type the number displayed in the text box in the game.
Play in the second mode:
When the keyboard is in "RAW" mode and raw data is received,
the game's code translates the received TAPCODE.
(The keyboard is very sensitive to any sensor movement, so be careful not to make unwanted movements.)
After the game, you can run the statistics.py file
to receive an analysis of your performance in the game.
